            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Hello my name is Sara Higgins. I am a student at Algoonquin College in the department of Media and Design. 
                My program of Interactive Media Design. I decided to do this course because in Quebec where I was, I did Visual Arts.
            I did enjoy doing art but I wanted to do more comupter art. So, I decided to do Interactive Media Design and learn coding.</p>
            <h2>My Goals:</h2>
            <p>My goals in this program is to get a job in this domain. 
                I love working with computers and using my ideas and creating websites with them.
                This is a new experience, I love learning.
                I can't wait to learn more about wesite making. Maybe one day I will Create a website for a brand for H<sub>2</sub>0. 
                It will be sad when the classes end on the 20<sup>th</sup> of December.
            </p>
